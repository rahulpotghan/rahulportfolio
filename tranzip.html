			<h4>About the project</h4>
			<p>Tranzip is a new & innovative way to ship packages. Tranzip connects people who are traveling to the same direction as the package destination and pays them for delivering the package to the senderâ€™s destination.
In today's market, we read about various startups utilizing social economy to disrupt the industry. There is a big problem people are experiencing with shipping, and applying social economy to solve this problem is analogous to two gears coming together to move the wheels.</p>

			<h4>My role</h4>
			<p>I was responsible for user flows, wireframes, functional specifications, and overall product design. I also collaborated with the analytics team to add features like one tap driver's travel plan, in-app marketplace etc.</p>

			<h3><span>Research and Goals:</span></h3>
				<p class="center">At the start of the project I did extensive research about logistics and the way people interact with devices to schedule delivery, send packets and pain points int he entire journey of sending packages though various means. With that, I created a mobile strategy for the Tranzip.
Once my reserach on user was completed the idea was to prototype new features and then bring users in to test them before committing to development effort. One of the initial challenges was ensuring that the findings themselves would be verifiable both to the team itself and to other stakeholders. Unlike quantitative data, where the numbers and graphs can be readily reproduced and shared with others in an email, the outcomes of qualitative research as notes taken based on observation could be open to interpretation. So it was critical that the process would be accountable. </p>

			<h4>Paper-Prototyping</h4>
			<p>Biggest improvements in user experience come from gathering usability data as early as possible in a design project and as paper prototyping does not involve tools and coding, it is my favorite weapon for iterative desgn approach. Measured usability can increase by an order of magnitude when you can change the project's basic approach to the problem, change the feature set, and change the user interface architecture.Shown below is some of my paper based prototyping approach. </p>

			<h4>Flow Chart</h4>
			    <p> After identifying the key user tasks I then developed low fidelity mock-ups, flow chart that support these activities. The prototype designs are put together using paper, sticky notes and acetates. We show the prototype designs to participants and ask them to carry out the tasks. We tell participants to use the paper prototype as they would a real user interface, pointing with their finger rather than a mouse. I like to keep simple and elegant and here is the part of flow chart that describes just the app signup process. </p>

			<h3><span>App Wireframes</span></h3>
				<p class="center">End-to-end prototyping allows us to test how design decisions early on in the process can influence customer behavior later in the experience, as well as catch any awkward seams that might occur between steps owned by different teams. By understading the right API's, underlying application layer my job was made real easy in designing hi-fi interactive. I am not a perfect graphic designer so we got branding guidelines and I worked closely with design team and thanks to the tools, photoshop and sketch. </p>
